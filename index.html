                <h3>Gender Disparity in Comics</h3>
                <p>Comics are mostly male-dominated. Women are usually token characters, and when portrayed, are over-sexualized and stereotyped; minority groups make even fewer appearances. Recent studies indicate that exposure to inaccurate representation of women in superhero comics decreased egalitarian beliefs in gender roles and lowered body esteem. Also, most of these representations are stereotyped based on the American perspective. In this age, when comic books and superhero movies are billion-dollar commodities, we aim to study Gender Representation in Comic books. By visualizing the disparity in Power, Moniker, Allegiance etc, we hope to understand the themes and beliefs around gender in Comic Books. We hope to better understand gender representation and spark meaningful discussions about the importance of accurate representation.

                        <p>Comic characters have titles such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Ms. Marvel, Spider-Man etc. However, the usage of “woman” and “man” in the titles are not balanced, male characters are given “man” far more frequently than female characters are given “woman”. On another note, female titles with “Girl” which is like a diminutive version of a woman appear more compared to male titles that have “Boy”. The “Girl” titles are the younger, or infantilized versions of another name. Females are more likely to be given a name that may make her seem weak, less dangerous, less aggressive and not on equal footing with male characters. The Wordle shows an interesting imbalance between many gendered naming pairs. </p>

                        <h3>Powerful Men; Psychic Women</h3>
                        <h4>The difference in male and female powers</h4>
                        <p>In dc and marvel, both genders have almost equal power distribution. 62.4% of all Male and 62.8% of all Female characters have power. But a close examination reveals interesting trend. Data suggests female super powers tend to be Psychic and Male tend to be Physical. While females are agile, males are strong with higher stamina and more gadgets. Ability to control or affect emotional and physical states occur five times as often in female character than male. Females dominate in some physical abilities – such as flight, pheromone control or sonic scream – but this too is tied to gender stereotypes. </p>

                        <h4>What's obvious</h4>
                        <p>Three out of five comic book characters have at least one superpower, regardless of gender. However, the above examination shows several trends of gender bias.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h6>Objectified</h6>
                                <p>Though Wonder Woman has her lasso, and Stargirl has a cosmic staff, it's generally the male characters that like their stuff. Think Thor and his hammer, or Iron Man and his suit.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>Mind your powers</h6>
                                <p>There is a clear trend here: Female characters are more often given non-physical,thought-induced abilities</p>
                            </li>

                        <h3>Creation bias</h3>
                        <h4>Comparing the origin of gendered characters over the years</h4>
                        <p>The bar chart shows a probing comparison of the number of comic characters that were introduced in each decade. As shown in the graphs (including both Marvel and DC), female characters have a least amount &#40;&#60;100&#41; of origins for Eight decades whereas male characters have a least amount &#40;&#60;100&#41; of origins only in Two decades. We can also infer that both Marvel and DC have tried to equate the disparate numbers by introducing more women characters between 1980 and 2010. However, the trend seems to decrease post 2010.</p>
